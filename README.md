DiffbotParsing
==============
It uses the Diffbot Article API to capture the semantic tags recognized for a set of links

 * You have to define your Diffbot API, the links you would like to analyze and a directory to save the txt file with the tags
 * It uses JSON-simple(code.google.com/p/json-simple) for the JSON parsing
